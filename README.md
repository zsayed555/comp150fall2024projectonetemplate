# COMP150 Fall 2024 Project One Template

This is a template for the first project in the COMP150 Fall 2024 course. The goal of this project is to create a simplified Dungeons & Dragons text-based game in Python.

## How to Run the Project

To run the example project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.6 installed on your machine.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project root directory (assumed to be named `comp150fall2024projectonetemplate`):

   ```bash
   cd comp150fall2024projectonetemplate
   ```

3. Run the game using Python:

   ```bash
   python project_code/src/main.py
   ```

### Game Flow

- The game will prompt you to select a party member and choose a statistic (e.g., Strength or Intelligence) to resolve various in-game events.
- Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to play through the game.

### Example

After running the game, you will see a series of prompts like:

```
A mysterious door blocks your path, with a riddle inscribed. What will you do?

Choose a party member:
1. Character_0
2. Character_1
3. Character_2

Enter the number of the chosen party member: 
```

Simply follow the prompts to make your choices and see the outcomes.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the provided unit tests, we recommend using `pytest`, a testing framework for Python.

#### Steps to Run Tests:

1. First, make sure `pytest` is installed on your machine:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Run the tests by navigating to the project root and executing the following command:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

This will discover and run all the tests in the `test/` directory.

### Example Test Output:

After running the tests, you should see output like this:

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 3 items

test/test_game.py ...                                                     [100%]

============================== 3 passed in 0.05s ===============================
```
